ipole-1DR  version 1.0  (released April, 2020)

The files in this directory are part of ipole. 

ipole is a program that solves the equations of polarized radiative transfer
in covariant form, using ray tracing. It produces images in Stokes I,Q,U,V
at the location of a "camera."   

This version is configured to integrate all Stokes parameters through a
slab of plasma in Minkowski space-time and assumes synchrotron emission and absorption
along with faraday rotation. Electron distribution function in optional
(thermal electrons or non-thermal, power-law, electrons). Integration scheme
is optional (1 step, 3 steps).
